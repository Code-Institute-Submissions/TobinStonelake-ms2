This is the second Milestone Project for the 
Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.

In this project, we have been asked to utilise the 
skills that have been developed with HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript throughout the course. By using JavaScript,
we can create dynamic and interactive websites that allow
for a greater user experience. As well as further
developing our skills to what is expected of a Full 
Stack Developer and to an industry standard.

As per the standard of Responsive Design, this site is
responsive across a number of devices, making sure to 
be structured in a cohesive manner and change designs
when appropriate. To further achieve this goal the site
utilises a number of Frameworks, APIs and embedded developer 
tools to also aid its design across a number of devices and 
broaden the skills and knowledge of the author.

This site, for the author's DJ act: *Jig & Thonic*, is a  
promotional site towards their events, songs, mixes and the 
implementation of EmailJS's API functionality to allow visitor's 
to contact the author with requests. Further complementing the 
use of APIs and the skills needed to effectively embed these within 
a development setting.Google Maps, Elfsight and Soundcloud's relevant 
developer tools have been utilised to achieve this aim.

## UX

### User Stories

* First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to hear the abilties
        of *Jig & Thonic* and reach their predominant social sites easily.
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to have access to the content
        produced by *Jig & Thonic* on one site, without having to visit several
        different sites.
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact *Jig & Thonic*
        with queries and ensure that a response will be given back within a declared
        timeframe.

* Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to view the progression of the author's work.
        Periodically and dynamically. This is aided by the use of embedded developer tools,
        which themselves update in real time as content is added to the relevant sites.
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact the author to be able to 
        collaborate and gain any extra information that they would like.
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want a singular portal where all of *Jig & Thonic's*
        material can be found and, thus, easily shared between others.

* Site Owner Goals
    1. The Site Owner's goal is to utilise digital platforms, particularly
        Social Media and other user-focused Content/Media sites to create
        a hub in which all of the promotional material can be found on one
        site.
    1. The Site Owner's goal will be to improve their ability 
        to be competitive within the dynamic and saturated DJ 
        market. This will be achieved by making contact easy and, as
        aforementioned, reach their other sites easily.
    1. The Site Owner's want to promote themselves effortlessly and 
        effectively, via the use of a centralised website.

### Design

* Colour Scheme
    * The colour scheme used has been likened to the colour scheme used 
        with *Jig & Thonic's* branding. This is a deep purple and white
        text. 
    * The author is also particularly keen on colour schemes that do
        not have bright backgrounds, due to the preferences of their 
        reading style and preferred digital interfaces.
    * By the choice of an unorthodox colour scheme, it also helps to define
        the content, while still keeping a uniformed style across all pages.
        User's still know that they are looking at *Jig & Thonic's* site, 
        although they are interacting with content embedded from other sites
        and APIs.

* Typography
    * Two fonts have been used across the site. 'Lily Script One' is the head font 
        used throughout the website due to the stylisation that *Jig & Thonic* have
        incorporated within their own branding and promotion. It is remnant of the 70/80s
        Disco themed writing, that the act promotes themselves as representing. To ensure
        that a similar font will be prevalent, Cursive serves as a fall back.
    * For the main text throughout the site, 'Yanone Kaffeesatz' has been used.
        In the author's view, this is also resmebeling a retro style font, thus, adhering
        to the same textual principle that is conveyed by the head font decision. This
        clearly defines head elements as being separate from the main text elements.
        This has Serif as a fallback, also complementing the nature of a defined element of text away from
        the remaining content.

* Imagery
    * Images have not been used widely across the site, this is as emphasis is towards the content.
        The content itself being very stylised and adhering to the design principles of the sites
        where the content has been embedded from.
    * Where this is not true is within the banner and footer to carry a cohesive branded look. This 
        includes *Jig & Thonic's* logo and familiar banner found on their other sites. 

* Wireframes
    * [Wireframe](assets/README_files/milestone_2.pdf)

## Features

* Responsive across all devices.

* Interactive elements:
    * The driving goal of this site was to present the User with various interactive 
        elements across each page. 
    * On the Homepage, the User can interact with *Jig & Thonic's* Facebook page,
        through a 'Widget' provided by Elfsight.            
    * On the Tracks page, the User can access songs and recorded mixes, created by the author,
        that have been uploaded to Soundcloud. This allows the User to keep up to date with
        the latest content that has been uploaded to Soundcloud.
    * On the Events page, a number of ficitious events have been marked on an embedded 
        Google Map. Details towards each event can be found below.
    * The contact page utilises MailJSs API so that User's can send queries and automatically
        recieve a response, informing the User of the timescale in which a response will be 
        given and thanks for contacting *Jig & Thonic*.

### Features left to implement

* In the future I would like to also include links to a YouTube channel and look at their 
    developer tools to see if a 'Widget', similar to that of the Facebook one that can
    be found on the Homepage, or whether it can be embedded and automatically updated by
    their developer tools alone.
* I also would of liked to have included bespoke custom markers, that give a little more 
    information on the Google Map, but I have not been able to figure this out effectively.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

**Disclaimer: All testing screenshots can be found after the relevant entry via a link.**

* First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to hear the abilties
        of *Jig & Thonic* and reach their predominant social sites easily.

        1. On the Hompage, a Facebook Widget has been included. This includes the latest 
        posts by *Jig & Thonic* and their recordings and events. [Facebook Widget Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/facebookwidget.png)
        2. On the Tracks page, embedded Soundcloud players are included. 
        Allowing User's to easily reach the predominant platform where *Jig & Thonic* upload
        their music. [Player Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/tracksimg.png)
        3. At the Footer on each page, links to the relevant social sites can be easily found.
        Utilising the icons of both sites to indicate where the User will be visiting. [Footer Social Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/socialimg.png)

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to have access to the content
        produced by *Jig & Thonic* on one site, without having to visit several
        different sites.

        1. The Navigation bar on each page clearly and distinctly leads the User to the relevant
        page that they are looking for. [Navbar Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/navbarimg.png)
        2. The benefit of using the Facebook widget and the Soundcloud embedded players is that it
        give User's the latest updates without any extra coding required across this page. Therfore,
        this aim is reached through their implementation. *Refer to above Facebook widget screenshot and the Player screenshot.
        3. By creating a centralised hub of *Jig & Thonic's* activity, it achieves this aim well and
        allows User's to also easily contact the author. Either through the contact form or their preferred social
        media avenue.  [Contact Form Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/contactimg.png)

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact *Jig & Thonic*
        with queries and ensure that a response will be given back within a declared
        timeframe.

        1. The Contact page utilises EmailJS, which sends an automated response to the user 
        once their query has been submitted.   [Auto-reply Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/emailjsautoreply.png)
        2. The timeframe is declared on both the auto-reply and on the contact page itself.
        [Auto-reply Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/contactnotice.png) 

* Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to view the progression of the author's work.
        Periodically and dynamically.

        1. As the user returns to the site, the site will be updated with *Jig & Thonic's* latest
        news, events and recordings.

    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact the author to be able to 
        collaborate and gain any extra information that they would like.

        1. There is a contact page that can be easily accessed from the navigation bar.
        2. The use of EmailJS ensures that the User's request is easily highlighted to the author
        and ensures that they will be responded to.
        3. A necessary caveat of being successful within the Club/Bar scene (the author's preferred setting),
        is that they are easily reachable to improve the employability prospects within this sector.

    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want a singular portal where all of *Jig & Thonic's*
        material can be found and, thus, easily shared between others. 

        1. The nature of the modern world and its increased use of mobile-technology means that a singular 
        hub is more important than ever. This ensures that a User has an easy to reach platform and does not
        require them to jump across multiple apps or pages to reach all of *Jig & Thonic's* content.
        2. Because of this singular, centralised hub of content. User's can easily share the page to
        others who may be interested in the site or conveyed their interest towards *Jig & Thonic*, via one link.

* Site Owner Goals
    1. The Site Owner's goal is to utilise digital platforms, particularly
        Social Media and other user-focused Content/Media sites to create
        a hub in which all of the promotional material can be found on one
        site.

        1. This aim is reached by the provision of the relevant developer tools from each site and their implementation.
        2. By using cross-platform services, the Site Owner has the ability to cater these tools themselves.
        As mentioned in the CSS, the Facebook widget had to be stylised within their own environment. This is indicated 
        through the following screenshot and achieved by using the inspect element tool on Google Chrome. 
        [Elfsight CSS Screenshot](assets/README_files/README_images/elfsightcustomisation.png) 

    1. The Site Owner's goal will be to improve their ability 
        to be competitive within the dynamic and saturated DJ 
        market. This will be achieved by making contact easy and, as
        aforementioned, reach their other sites easily.

        1. By the use of a centralised hub, the author can easily showcase any and all work
        that has gone into *Jig & Thonic*. This makes it easy for prospective clients to gain an indication
        of their abilities and make an informed decision towards the viability of *Jig & Thonic* for their needs.
        2. Because of this, it saves both the client and *Jig & Thonic* time in ensuring that an efficient
        and effective service is delivered. Backed by the use of social media to indicate their presence and as a
        portfolio of work.
        3. By using an automated email service, clients can easily contact the author to create a correspondence.
        This greatly improves the financial prospects towards their service becoming used. 

    1. The Site Owner's want to promote themselves effortlessly and 
        effectively, via the use of a centralised website.

        1. This is the main focal point of the site's creation. Once the author's skillset has been further
        developed and extra content is created and uploaded to sites such as YouTube, Spotify and Mixcloud,
        the author will also implement these via their respective development tools.
        2. This can also be said for a shopping basket with different services that can be offered. For the
        moment, the author was advised to wait until their skillset was further developed with the Code Institute,
        as this will be a necessary criterion in a later module.

### Achieved Testing

* Throughout the project, I have been viewing my site across a
number of devices. Including mobiles, tablets, a range of monitors
with different ratios and utilising the inspect element capability 
on Google Chrome to give me further insight into how the site 
functions across devices that I do not have access to.

* During this period, my main focus was to ensure that the site 
was responsive, followed its theme and was as visually appealing
and useable across all devices.

* My largest issue has been with the footer image. This required several tweaks
to ensure that the footer looked and responded well across all media queries.

* EmailJS has been tested and deployed on the site as it works as expected. Emails
can be sent and an uto-reply is received.

* Checked all links across all pages lead to the relevant pages.

* All external links open a new tab using the _blank attribute.

* If the products page is to be included, then there are some minor tweaks that need to 
be rectified. If it is, this will serve as giving the client an indication of the cost 
of the services that can be provided. 

### Further Testing

* The font size may need to be tweaked to ensure that readibility is preserved across all
devices.

### Known Issues

* There are some final little aesthetic issues that I would like to fix:
    * The footer copyright text can become a tad too small when viewed on certain devices.
    * Text can appear quite large on smaller devices.
    * On some devices, the Contact Page footer image is very large.

* At present, the Products page, which is not known whether it will be included or not,
seems to double up when adding to the basket at the bottom. This will require some tweaking
to overcome this issue.

### W3 Validators

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page. 
This led to a number of errors being present and resolutions needed to overcome said issues.
Evidence of these tests can be found below:

* As a sidenote, at the time of writing I had two errors that were unable to be fixed until
assurance is provided by my mentor or student support. One is that I get an error due to the
use of the type attribute when linking JavaScript resources. The other is that I get a failure
on the tracks page due to the embedded styling found on the Soundcloud players. It notes that 
this should be in the CSS folder.
