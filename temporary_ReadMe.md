This is the second Milestone Project for the 
Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.

In this project, we have been asked to utilise the 
skills that have been developed with HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript throughout the course. By using JavaScript,
we can create dynamic and interactive websites that allow
for a greater user experience. As well as further
developing our skills to what is expected of a Full 
Stack Developer and to an industry standard.

As per the standard of Responsive Design, this site is
responsive across a number of devices, making sure to 
be structured in a cohesive manner and change designs
when appropriate. To further achieve this goal the site
utilises a number of Frameworks, APIs and embedded developer 
tools to also aid its design across a number of devices and 
broaden the skills and knowledge of the author.

This site, for the author's DJ act: *Jig & Thonic*, is a  
promotional site towards their events, songs, mixes and the 
implementation of EmailJS's API functionality to allow visitor's 
to contact the author with requests. Further complementing the 
use of APIs and the skills needed to effectively embed these within 
a development setting.Google Maps, Elfsight and Soundcloud's relevant 
developer tools have been utilised to achieve this aim.

## UX

### User Stories

* First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to hear the abilties
        of *Jig & Thonic* and reach their predominant social sites easily.
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to have access to the content
        produced by *Jig & Thonic* on one site, without having to visit several
        different sites.
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact *Jig & Thonic*
        with queries and ensure that a response will be given back within a declared
        timeframe.

* Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to view the progression of the author's work.
        Periodically and dynamically. This is aided by the use of embedded developer tools,
        which themselves update in real time as content is added to the relevant sites.
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact the author to be able to 
        collaborate and gain any extra information that they would like.
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want a singular portal where all of *Jig & Thonic's*
        material can be found and, thus, easily shared between others.

* Site Owner Goals
    1. The Site Owner's goal is to utilise digital platforms, particularly
        Social Media and other user-focused Content/Media sites to create
        a hub in which all of the promotional material can be found on one
        site.
    1. The Site Owner's goal will be to improve their ability 
        to be competitive within the dynamic and saturated DJ 
        market. This will be achieved by making contact easy and, as
        aforementioned, reach their other sites easily.
    1. The Site Owner's want to promote themselves effortlessly and 
        effectively, via the use of a centralised website.

### Design

* Colour Scheme
    * The colour scheme used has been likened to the colour scheme used 
        with *Jig & Thonic's* branding. This is a deep purple and white
        text. 
    * The author is also particularly keen on colour schemes that do
        not have bright backgrounds, due to the preferences of their 
        reading sytle and preferred digital interfaces.
    * By the choice of an unorthodox colour scheme, it also helps to define
        the content, while still keeping a uniformed style across all pages.
        User's still know that they are looking at *Jig & Thonic's* site, 
        although they are interacting with content embedded from other sites
        and APIs.

* Typography
    * Two fonts have been used across the site. 'Lily Script One' is the head font 
        used throughout the website due to the stylisation that *Jig & Thonic* have
        incorporated within their own branding and promotion. It is remnant of the 70/80s
        Disco themed writing, that the act promotes themselves as representing. To ensure
        that a similar font will be prevalent, Cursive serves as a fall back.
    * For the main text throughout the site, 'Yanone Kaffeesatz' has been used.
        In the author's view, this is also resmebeling a retro style font, thus, adhering
        to the same textual principle that is conveyed by the head font decision. This
        clearly defines head elements as being separate from the main text elements.
        This has Serif as a fallback, also complementing the nature of a defined element of text away from
        the remaining content.

* Imagery
    * Images have not been used widely across the site, this is as emphasis is towards the content.
        The content itself being very stylised and adhering to the design principles of the sites
        where the content has been embedded from.
    * Where this is not true is within the banner and footer to carry a cohesive branded look. This 
        includes *Jig & Thonic's* logo and familiar banner found on their other sites. 

* Wireframes
    * [Wireframe](assets/images/wireframe.pdf)

## Features

* Responsive across all devices.

* Interactive elements:
    * The driving goal of this site was to present the User with various interactive 
        elements across each page. 
    * On the Homepage, the User can interact with *Jig & Thonic's* Facebook page,
        through a 'Widget' provided by Elfsight.            
    * On the Tracks page, the User can access songs and recorded mixes, created by the author,
        that have been uploaded to Soundcloud. This allows the User to keep up to date with
        the latest content that has been uploaded to Soundcloud.
    * On the Events page, a number of ficitious events have been marked on an embedded 
        Google Map. Details towards each event can be found below.
    * The contact page utilises MailJSs API so that User's can send queries and automatically
        recieve a response, informing the User of the timescale in which a response will be 
        given and thanks for contacting *Jig & Thonic*.

### Features left to implement

* In the future I would like to also include links to a YouTube channel and look at their 
    developer tools to see if a 'Widget', similar to that of the Facebook one that can
    be found on the Homepage, or whether it can be embedded and automatically updated by
    their developer tools alone.
* I also would of liked to have included bespoke custom markers, that give a little more 
    information on the Google Map, but I have not been able to figure this out effectively.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

**Disclaimer: All testing screenshots can be found after the relevant entry via a link.**

* First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily access the
        authors own projects and contact page from the homepage and navigation bar. 

        1. The navigation bar is fixed across all pages and links to each page. [Navigation Bar Screenshot](assets/images/navbar.png)
        2. On smaller devices, the navigation links are combined into a dropdown button. [Button Screenshot](assets/images/button.png)
        3. The cards at the bottom of the homepage indicate what each page is about and has an easy to find button
            take the user to the relevant site. [Card Screenshot](assets/images/card.png)

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I wish to be able to learn more about the content
        that is presented across the site.

        1. At the bottom of each of the blog pages, there is a modal which pops up with all citations used
            within the content. [Modal Screenshot](assets/images/modalbtn.png)
        2. Once the modal has been opened, each source has been referenced following the Harvard
            referencing system. An industry standard for content of this nature. [Modal Content Screenshot](assets/images/modcnt.png)
        3. Any sources, which are the majority, that can be found online have the relevant link to access
            the source. [Modal Link Screenshot](assets/images/modlink.png)

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to gain a perspective towards the capabilities
        of the author's academic potential. In terms of both political theory and development.

        1. The content of the page clearly conveys the authors academic potential.
        2. Due to the nature of this being a website also built by the content author, 
            it clearly conveys the technical capabilities towards their development skills.

* Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to view the progression of the author's work.
        Periodically and dynamically.

        1. As the user returns to the site, the site will be updated with new articles as
            soon as they are completed.

    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact the author to be able to 
        collaborate and gain any extra information that they would like. [Contact Page Screenshot](assets/images/contactpg.png)

        1. There is a contact page that can be easily accessed from the navigation bar and homepage.
        2. Within this contact page, there are several mediums that could potentially lead to
            contacting the author.

    1. As a Returning or Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to have a number of different options towards 
        contacting the author.

        1. On the footer, social media links can be found across all pages. Allowing the user to
            contact the author dynamically, even if they are not on the contact page. [Social Links Screenshot](assets/images/socmed.png)
        2. Email, YouTube, Facebook and LinkedIn information is provided on the contact page.

* Site Owner Goals
    1. The Site Owner's goal is to utilise digital platforms to 
        shape a personal portfolio of the author's academic research
        and written work.

        1. The site clearly conveys on the homepage cards the nature of the content that has been
            written and which projects the content can be attributed. [Original Source/Idea Screenshot](assets/images/cardethos.png)
        2. With the use of the modal at the bottom of each page, any user can easily find the sources
            that the author amassed and based the written content on. [Modal Content Screenshot](assets/images/modcnt.png)

    1. The Site Owner's goal will improve their chance of employability
        by highlighting the capabilities of the author across a 
        number of academic disciplines: Political Philosophy and 
        Full Stack Development.

        1. The content included has been the highest graded pieces of work that the author has written.
            Therefore, it reflects the most academically sound ability of the author.
        2. By using a digital platform to showcase the author's work, it conveys the development ability
            that the author also has.
        3. The choice towards the aesthetic design principles across the site highlights the creative
            eye for detail that the author has in presenting their own work. Across both disciplines. 

    1. The Site Owner's indication towards this goal is the 
        choice to include a contact page for the author to promote 
        collaboration and allow potential employers or anyone interested in the site content, can reach out to the author.

        1. Contact information can easily be found on the footer, across all pages, and through
            a dedicated contact page. [Contact Page Screenshot](assets/images/contactpg.png) / [Footer Social Links Screenshot](assets/images/socmed.png)

### Achieved Testing

* Throughout the project, I have been viewing my site across a
number of devices. Including mobiles, tablets, a range of monitors
with different ratios and utilising the inspect element capability 
on Google Chrome to give me further insight into how the site 
functions across devices that I do not have access to.

* During this period, my main focus was to ensure that the site 
was responsive, followed its theme and was as visually appealing
and was useable across all devices.

* My largest issue has been with the navigation bar and footer.
This is due to issues with them overlapping or underlapping
the primary page content. Their general size across the pages
has also given me difficulties.

* Overcoming the aria-controls error I had when validating my code,
    required me to refer to Stack Overflow.

* Checked all links across all pages lead to the relevant pages.

* All external links open a new tab using the _blank attribute.

* I was unable to work out why there are two error messages on my index.html validation.
    To my knowledge, I do have a h1 element, upon the overlay, and I had the same issue
    previously with my other HTML pages. This needed to be outside the section, as a child
    of the article.

### Further Testing

* In some instances, my pictures fully are not fully
    responsive. 

### Known Issues

* There are some final little aesthetic issues that I would like to fix:
    * On some devices elements also become slightly unaligned, such as 
        the URM on the top right of the navigation bar.
    * When smaller devices are used in landscape mode, the footer on the
        contact page seems to be much larger than on other devices.
    * When smaller devices are used in landscape mode, some of the images can
        also become shrunk.
    * On some devices, the Contact Page footer is very large.

* The picture becomes cropped at certain
    media queries and I have been unable to rectify this issue within
    the timeframe of the project.

* One visual issue that I am unable to overcome is the margins when switching to
    the Galaxy Fold emulator on Google Chrome's inspect function. Unsure whether this
    is a browser issue or an issue that relates to my code. Is not affected
    on any other emulated devices, though it does carry this issue through
    after clicking on another emulated device. This latter aspect inspires
    confidence that is a Chrome issue, rather than with my own code.
